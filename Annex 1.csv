Thesaurus of Plant Characteristics for Ecology and Evolution;TOP;The Thesaurus Of Plant characteristics (TOP), aims to harmonize and formalize concepts for plant characteristics widely used in ecology. TOP concentrates on two types of plant characteristics: traits and environmental associations. Characteristics are modelled as the ‘Quality’ of an ‘Entity’ used in the context of Open Biological Ontologies. Whenever possible, the Entities and Qualities are taken from existing terminology standards, mainly the Plant Ontology (PO) and Phenotypic Quality Ontology (PATO) ontologies. TOP provides names, definitions, units, synonyms and related terms for about 850 plant characteristics.;https://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/TOP;AgroPortal;Ontology;OWL;OWL, RDF/XML, CSV;Biosphere;Not specified;v1;2023-07-06

Global Agricultural Concept Scheme;GACS;"The Global Agricultural Concept Space (GACS) is a hub for concepts related to agriculture, in multiple languages, for use in Linked Data. GACS Core is the first of potentially many concept schemes in this larger concept space. The idea for GACS emerged out of discussions at the World Congress of IAALD, the International Association of Agricultural Information Specialists, in July 2013. The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), CAB International (CABI), and the National Agricultural Library of the USA (NAL) agreed in October 2013 to explore the feasibility of developing a shared concept scheme by integrating their three thesauri: the AGROVOC Concept Scheme, the CAB Thesaurus (CABT), and NAL Thesaurus (NALT). In the
GACS vision, the integration of these three thesauri was the first step towards the realization of a hub that links to and from the concept schemes beyond the initial three, and in multiple language areas.

The relevance of OntoBiotope terms is evaluated through the PubMedBiotope semantic search engine. It identifies and categorizes microbial biotopes in all PubMed abstracts by applying the ToMap method (Text to Ontology Mapping) to the OntoBiotope ontology. It also indexes 3,35 millions relations between taxa and their habitats.;https://data.inra.fr/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.15454/1.4382640528105164E12;AgroPortal, FAIRsharing;Ontology;OWL;RDF/XML, CSV, OBO;Biosphere;CC BY ND 4.0;01/10/21;2023-07-04
Plant Phenology Ontology;PPO;Plant phenology — the timing of plant life-cycle events, such as flowering or leafing-out — has cascading effects on multiple levels of biological organization, from individuals to ecosystems, and is crucial for understanding the links between climate and biological communities. Plant phenology data are collected and used by many different types of researchers, from plant breeders to ecosystem ecologists. Today, thanks to data digitization and aggregation initiatives, phenology monitoring networks, and the efforts of citizen scientists, more phenologically relevant data is available than ever before. Unfortunately, combining these data in large-scale analyses remains prohibitively difficult, mostly because the individuals and organizations producing the data are using non-standardized terminologies and metrics during data collection and processing. Lack of standardization remains particularly problematic for historical datasets, which are crucial for time-based analyses. The Plant Phenology Ontology (PPO) is a collaborative effort to help solve these problems by developing the standardized terminology, definitions, and relations that are needed for large-scale data integration. The PPO builds on the widely used Plant Ontology (PO) and Phenotype and Trait Ontology (PATO) to promote broad reuse of phenological data. The initial use case for the PPO is integration of citizen science data from the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN) and the Pan-European Phenology Network (PEP), but work is also planned for integrating data from herbaria.;https://agroportal.lirmm.fr/ontologies/PPO;AgroPortal, FAIRsharing, BioPortal, Bioregistry, OLS, AberOWL, OBO Foundry, I-ADOPT, Ontobee;Ontology;OWL;OWL, RDF/XML, CSV;Biosphere;CC BY 3.0;26/10/18;2023-07-05

Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia Codes;IBRA7;Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA) version 7.0 represents a landscape based approach to classifying the land surface of Australia. 89 biogeographic regions and 419 sub regions have been delineated, each reflecting a unifying set of major environmental influences which shape the occurrence of flora and fauna and their interaction with the physical environment across Australia and its external territories (excluding Antarctica). IBRA Version 7.0 data consists of two datasets. IBRA bioregions, which is a larger scale regional classification of homogenous ecosystems, and sub regions, which are more localised. IBRA Version 7.0 is the result of both significant changes to certain IBRA 6.1 boundaries, plus refinement of other boundaries due to better data availability amongst some states and territories, and alterations by the states/territories along state borders. The updated boundaries were jointly defined by the Commonwealth, State and Territory nature and conservation agencies. In this respect refinements were carried out to all mainland jurisdictions with significant changes in Queensland and South Australia. In addition the dataset was also updated to more closely conform to the Geoscience Australia 1:100K State borders, and a standard coding/naming convention introduced (for both regions and sub-regions) resulting in differences to both names and codes used in earlier IBRA Versions. Various sources were used to delineate islands - these included the GA100K Admin layer plus the Australian Maritime Boundaries dataset, a Coral Sea dataset (held in ERIN) and the GA Commonwealth Fisheries 2006 dataset.;https://vocabs.ardc.edu.au/viewById/266;ARDC;Thesaurus;SKOS;Turtle;Geosphere;CC BY 3.0 AU;1.2.1;2023-07-06

Standard Australian Classification of Countries;SACC;"The SACC is a classification of countries essentially based on the concept of geographic proximity. In its structure, it groups neighbouring countries into progressively broader geographic areas on the basis of their similarity in terms of social, cultural, economic and political characteristics.

The SACC has a three-level hierarchical structure. The third, and most detailed, level consists of the base units which are countries. The second level comprises 27 minor groups, which are groups of neighbouring countries similar in terms of social, cultural, economic and political characteristics. Each minor group lies wholly within the boundaries of a geographic continent. The first, and most general, level comprises nine major groups which are formed by aggregating geographically proximate minor groups. With the exception of North Africa and the Middle East, and Americas, each major group lies wholly within the bounds of a single geographic continent.

The classification also provides standard alternative groups of countries associated for economic or political purposes.";https://vocabs.ardc.edu.au/viewById/133;ARDC, BARTOC;Gazetteer;NONE;CSV;Geosphere;CC BY 3.0 AU;2016;2023-07-07

QUDT semantic specifications for units of measure, quantity kind, dimensions and data types;QUDT;"The QUDT, or ""Quantity, Unit, Dimension and Type"" schema defines the base classes properties, and restrictions used for modeling physical quantities, units of measure, and their dimensions in various measurement systems. The goal of the QUDT ontology is to provide a unified model of, measurable quantities, units for measuring different kinds of quantities, the numerical values of quantities in different units of measure and the data structures and data types used to store and manipulate these objects in software.

Except for unit prefixes, all units are specified in separate vocabularies. Descriptions are provided in both HTML and LaTeX formats. A quantity is a measure of an observable phenomenon, that, when associated with something, becomes a property of that thing; a particular object, event, or physical system.

A quantity has meaning in the context of a measurement (i.e. the thing measured, the measured value, the accuracy of measurement, etc.) whereas the underlying quantity kind is independent of any particular measurement. Thus, length is a quantity kind while the height of a rocket is a specific quantity of length; its magnitude that may be expressed in meters, feet, inches, etc. Or, as stated at Wikipedia, in the language of measurement, quantities are quantifiable aspects of the world, such as time, distance, velocity, mass, momentum, energy, and weight, and units are used to describe their measure. Many of these quantities are related to each other by various physical laws, and as a result the units of some of the quantities can be expressed as products (or ratios) of powers of other units (e.g., momentum is mass times velocity and velocity is measured in distance divided by time).";http://www.qudt.org/2.1/catalog/qudt-catalog.html;ARDC, BioPortal, LOV, GFBio Terminology Service, Bioregistry, BARTOC, FAIRsharing, I-ADOPT;Ontology;OWL;OWL, CSV, RDF/XML, Turtle;All;CC BY 4.0;Not specified;2023-07-05

Ecolexicon - Terminological Knowledge Base on the Environment;EcoLexicon;EcoLexicon, a multilingual knowledge resource on the environment, provides an internally coherent information system covering a wide range of specialized linguistic and conceptual needs. Data in our terminological knowledge base (TKB) are primarily hosted in a relational database which is now linked to an ontology in order to apply reasoning techniques and enhance user queries. The advantages of ontological reasoning can only be obtained if conceptual description is based on systematic criteria and a wide inventory of non-hierarchical relations, which confer dynamism to knowledge representation. Thus, our research has mainly focused on conceptual modelling and providing a user-friendly multimodal interface. The dynamic interface, which combines conceptual (networks and definitions), linguistic (contexts, concordances) and graphical information offers users the freedom to surf it according to their needs. Furthermore, dynamism is also present at the representational level. Contextual constraints have been applied to reconceptualise versatile concepts that cause a great deal of information overload.;http://ecolexicon.ugr.es/visual/index_en.html;BARTOC;Ontology;OWL;OWL;All;Not specified;Not specified;2023-06-30
General Finnish ontology;YSO;"General Finnish Ontology YSO is a trilingual ontology consisting mainly of general concepts. YSO has been founded on the basis of concepts in Finnish cultural sphere. As an indexing tool it is best applicable when indexed material is interdiscliplinary and its themes vary to a great extent. YSO's hierarchical construction is founded on parent-child relationships. In addition to this, some concepts are supplemented with associative and part-whole relations. Each concept in YSO is issued to at least one thematic group and some concepts have also been grouped with a non-hierarchical collection label (such as ""clothes by materials""). Following the international standards for thesauri, the terms for concepts are usually plural nouns. Terms in singular are usually mass nouns or terms referring to actions or abstract concepts. Some terms carry a different meaning when used in plural and in singular. For example, ballet refers to an art form and ballets to individual works of art. Place names are contained in a separate ontology, YSO places. YSO is based on General Finnish Thesaurus (YSA) and General Finnish Thesaurus in Swedish (Allärs). Concepts in YSO and concepts in YSA and Allärs have been linked to each other with equivalence relationships. YSO has also been linked to Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH).";http://finto.fi/yso/en/;BARTOC;Thesaurus;SKOS;RDF/XML, Turtle, MARCXML/Finnish, MARCXML/Swedish;All;CC BY 4.0;Not specified;2023-07-03
Law & Environment Ontology;LEO;LEO aims to provide an agreed to semantic standard for any institution or organization that collects and manages data, information and knowledge in the field of Environmental Law and Governance. The development of a semantic Ontology for Multilateral Environmental Agreements (MEAs) and International Environmental Law was identified as a priority for MEA Secretariats and UNEP at the first meeting of the MEA Information and Knowledge Management (IKM) Initiative. Members to the MEA IKM Initiative agreed on the need for a ‘controlled vocabulary’ to allow for easier searching, locating and retrieving of MEA information such as decisions by MEA governing bodies and meeting documents, reports and national plans. Generous financial support from the European Union provided for the review and enhancement of the draft InforMEA glossary through a Multi-Stakeholder process. The MEA IKM Initiative identified the IUCN Environmental Law Centre as collaborator in the development of the next version of the vocabulary and chose the FAO’s VOCbench system as the platform for the development and maintenance of the vocabulary. The IKM Initiative also reached out to organizations involved in the development of thesauri, such as the European Environment Agency’s GEMET, the ECOLEX and the FAOlex glossary.;https://www.informea.org/en/terms;BARTOC;Glossary;SKOS;RDF/XML;All;Not specified;Not specified;2023-07-03

Just Enough Results Model;JERM;The JERM provides a framework to describe SEEK assets and the relationships between assets and the experiments that created them. Crucially, all assets are related to the scientists that created them and the projects they originate from, so the model captures provenance information as well as physical links between assets. JERM definitions for each type of data in SEEK is different, but highly overlapping and they comply with existing MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) guidelines where they are available. The JERM describes what type of experiment was performed, who performed it, and what was measured. These elements are common to all data types in Systems Biology, but each data type (e.g. microarray, mass spectrometry, enzymatic reactions), requires a different set of additional metadata. For enzyme experiments, the reactions being catalyzed need to be recorded, with substrates, products, and details of inhibition. For microarray experiments, the methods for quality control and normalization of the data should be recorded. For proteomics or metabolomics with mass spectrometry, detailed descriptions of the instruments are required. For all cases, however, a description of the biological samples and any treatments applied is essential in order to understand the results of the experiment.;https://jermontology.org/;BioPortal, AberOWL, FAIRsharing;Ontology;OWL;OWL, CSV, RDF/XML;Biosphere;"BSD 3 Clause ""New"" or ""Revised"" License";v2;2023-07-03

Plant Experimental Assay Ontology;PEAO;The Plant domain has been the subject of several attempts to structure and formally define terms and corresponding relations, such as their anatomical features, developmental stages, and the application of particular experimental procedures to a biological problem. However, a focus on experimental assays in order to describe the whole experimental procedure, to the best of our knowledge, has only been attempted in the context of a very general description based on classical views of the scientific method. In this study, we focus on the development and proposal of an ontology dedicated to the description of these experimental procedures, regardless of the scientific questions that prompted the assays. This ontology includes entities from three distinct realms (biological, physical and data), which include both experimental products, their relations and the protocols describing their manipulation. The final outcome is a useful and comprehensive ontology in the plant domain, to be used as a log book by experimentalists, providing a formal relation between entities.;https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PEAO/?p=summary;BioPortal, AgroPortal, FAIRsharing;Ontology;OWL;OWL, RDF/XML, CSV;Biosphere;Not specified;Not specified;2023-07-05

The classes of PDO also capture the habitat, environmental conditions and expand the general characteristics of plants, completing the instances richness for plant species, geographical, classification and morphology. Furthermore, PDO builds the relationships among species, region, morphology, plant organs, developmental stage, revealing the list of species in an area, the morphology and life form of plants, and development process of species. In sum, PDO shows a growth process or development stage of a species and its structure characteristics in particular space and time scale, realizing the description of species diversity, ecosystem diversity and genetic diversity. At present, PDO has been applied to the platform of Go to Selected Open Access Journals (GoOA) developed by National Science Library of Chinese Academy of Sciences, supporting concept retrieval and concept extension for GoOA.;https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/PDO_CAS;BioPortal, FAIRsharing;Ontology;OWL;OWL, RDF/XML, CSV;Biosphere;Not specified;Not specified;2023-07-05

PLOS thesaurus;Not specified;"The ""Subject Areas"" panel on each article page displays a set of terms selected for that article based on its content. The Subject Areas belong to a thesaurus of over 10,000 terms initially built for us over the course of 2012 by Access Innovations, taking into account the controlled vocabulary of classification terms that had been in use in PLOS Editorial Manager. The entire corpus of PLOS articles was analysed to ensure that the thesaurus covers the research domain comprehensively. Specific terms are associated with articles by Machine Aided Indexing (MAI) which identifies text strings in the articles and matches them to Subject Area terms from the thesaurus. The output ranks the matches in order of frequency of hits within the text of the article and the top eight terms are selected for display. Whereas previously the eight terms were presented in alphabetical order, we are introducing weightings to the Subject Area panel, such that the order of Subject Areas will reflect the frequency of hits in the MAI process. This new presentation will be introduced progressively, beginning with the main Article tab. The MAI process uses a Rulebase to guide Subject Area selection. Whereas identifying a phrase such as ""Retinitis pigmentosa"" is relatively straightforward for software, the issue is more complex for a word such as ""Sodium"" where the relevant Subject Area might be ""Voltage-gated sodium channels"", any of several sodium compounds or even just ""Sodium"" the element. The rule for terms such as ""Sodium"" are therefore compound and include conditional statements to disambiguate these different contexts. While the vast majority of terms are effectively indexed there remain ambiguities for some terms and part of our work is to continue to identify these cases and modify the Rulebase accordingly. The Subject Area terms are related to each other with a system of broader/narrower term relationships. The thesaurus structure is a polyhierarchy, so for example the Subject Area ""White blood cells"" has two broader terms ""Blood cells"" and ""Immune cells"". At its deepest the hierarchy is ten tiers deep, with all terms tracking back to one or more of the top tier Subject Areas, such as ""Biology and life sciences"" or ""Social sciences"". The Subject Area terms can be used to access PLOS articles via Advanced Search. The MAI Rulebase accommodates synonyms, so a Subject-specific Search for ""Highly active antiretroviral therapy"" will retrieve articles based on MAI matches to ""HAART"" (a known synonym) as well as ""Highly active antiretroviral therapy"" in one step. Additionally, because we select the most frequently MAI-indexed Subject Areas for each article the Search returns articles where the Subject Area in question ranks highly enough to be included in the top eight MAI-retrieved terms, so is of relatively high significance, whereas a query term in an ""All fields"" search will return every article that contains even a single match to the query term. The hierarchical nature of the thesaurus also enhances article retrieval in Search. Not only does Search retrieve all articles specifically indexed by MAI with the query Subject Area term in question, but it also retrieves all articles specifically indexed with any Subject Area term that sits deeper into the hierarchy than the query Subject Area term, but on the same broader/narrower term path. Thus, in the ""White blood cells"" example, queries for either ""Blood cells"" or ""Immune cells"" will return all articles indexed with ""White blood cells"". The Subject Area terms on all article pages are hyperlinked and following the link returns a listing of all articles to which that Subject Area term applies. Subject Area terms can also be used as the basis for Saved Searches, RSS feeds and PLOS ONE customized Journal Alerts. The content of the PLOS thesaurus and the Rulebase that governs the application of Subject Areas to the articles is constantly under review. We incorporate analysis of the Subject Area panel ""feedback"" clicks into this review process, and are always happy to receive specific input on Subject Area terms and their application by email. We update the thesaurus behind the PLOS sites several times each year.

Integrated Taxonomic Information System;ITIS;"he White House Subcommittee on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Dynamics has identified systematics as a research priority that is fundamental to ecosystem management and biodiversity conservation. This primary need identified by the Subcommittee requires improvements in the organization of, and access to, standardized nomenclature. ITIS (originally referred to as the Interagency Taxonomic Information System) was designed to fulfill these requirements. In the future, the ITIS will provide taxonomic data and a directory of taxonomic expertise that will support the system. The ITIS is the result of a partnership of federal agencies formed to satisfy their mutual needs for scientifically credible taxonomic information. Since its inception, ITIS has gained valuable new partners and undergone a name change; ITIS now stands for the Integrated Taxonomic Information System.

Here, we document the Paleoenvironmental Standard Terms (PaST) thesaurus, the first authoritative vocabulary of standardized variable names for paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental data developed in a formal knowledge organization structure. This structure is designed to improve data set discovery, support automated processing of data, and provide connectivity to other vocabularies. PaST is now used operationally at the World Data Service for Paleoclimatology (WDS-Paleo), one of the largest repositories of paleoscience information.

I-ADOPT Framework Ontology;I-ADOPT;The I-ADOPT Framework is an ontology primarily designed to facilitate interoperability between existing variable description models (including ontologies, taxonomy, and structured controlled vocabularies). One of the challenges in representing semantic descriptions of variables is getting people to agree about what they mean when describing the components that define the variables. The I-ADOPT ontology addresses this by providing core components and their relations that can be applied to define machine-interpretable variable descriptions that re-use FAIR vocabulary terms. It was developed by a core group of terminology experts and users from the Research Data Alliance (RDA) InteroperAble Descriptions of Observable Property Terminology (I-ADOPT) Working Group. The first published versions of the ontology up to v0.9.1 satisfied the basic cross-domain interoperability requirements. This new version of the ontology (v1.0) includes exactly the same original components plus an extension which is designed to support the aggregation of variables using a range of user-defined coarser concepts to facilitate dataset discovery and aggregation into products.;https://i-adopt.github.io/index.html;I-ADOPT, LOV;Ontology;OWL;Turtle, JSON-LD, RDF/XML, N-Triples;All;CC BY 4.0;1;2023-07-06
